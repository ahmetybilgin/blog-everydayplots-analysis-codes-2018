# EverydayPlots.com - All Analysis Codes

This Github repo contains all the data analysis codes (Python / R) for the blog posts published by me on my data analytics blog: https://www.everydayplots.com

Here is a list of the blog posts I've published in 2018:

### Post 1: Identifying Forced And Fake Twitter Trends Using R

Link: https://www.everydayplots.com/identifying-forced-fake-twitter-trends-r/

In this post, I've explained a way to use R with the Twitter API data to identify potentially fake / forced trends on Twitter. Using data analysis and visualization, we're trying to identify how we can differentiate real / natural Twitter trends from the forced / propaganda / fake trends showing up in the ‘trending’ tab.

### Post 2: Instagram Hashtag Analysis In Python

Link: https://www.everydayplots.com/instagram-hashtag-analysis-python/

In this post, I've explained a way to use Python with Selenium + BeautifulSoup + ChromeDriver to extract and analyse hashtag data from Instagram web. We are using data analysis techniques to find and extract a list of hashtags, identify which of those hashtags are popular / niche / relevant and finally which of those tags are best for our own use based on posting frequency and popularity.
