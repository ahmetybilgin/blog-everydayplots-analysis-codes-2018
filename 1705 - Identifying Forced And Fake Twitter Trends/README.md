### Introduction

Twitter has become a toxic place. There, I said it. It is no longer the fun and happy place it used to be a few years back, certainly not in India. It is now full of trolls, rude and nasty people, politicians and companies busy trying to sell their products or spreading propaganda.

But I still love Twitter. Partly because it is not Facebook (that’s a good enough reason). However it pains me see the negativity every time I visit it. As a user, it appears that the Twitter team isn’t moving fast and hard enough to eliminate the problem of trolls and propaganda. So I decided to approach this problem on my own, doing what I do best – data analysis. In this post, I use the Twitter data to perform a basic data analysis in R to analyze a very specific part of the problem – unnaturally trending hashtags and trends on Twitter.

### Summary

In this post, I've explained a way to use R with the Twitter API data to identify potentially fake / forced trends on Twitter. This is based on the posting frequency pattern and duplicity of the tweets. We are trying to answer the following question using data:

- How can we identify and differentiate real / natural Twitter trends from the forced / propaganda / fake trends showing up in the ‘trending’ tab?

### Output

The output contains the following values:
- Tweet frequency pattern diagrams
- A table of duplicate posts with frequency

We can export this list to a CSV file and analyse it further in Excel.
